# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with the **dashboard** project in the Wildtrip monorepo.

## Project Overview

This is the React-based admin dashboard for managing Wildtrip content. Built with Vite, React, and shadcn/ui, it provides a rich interface for content management.

**Role in Monorepo:** This project will handle all administrative functions including species management, protected areas, news articles, media gallery, and user management. It communicates with the backend API and uses shared types from `@wildtrip/shared`.

## Current Status (Enero 2025)

âœ… **Migration Complete**: Dashboard is fully functional with all management features migrated from the web project.

### Completed:
- âœ… React + TypeScript setup with Vite
- âœ… React Router v6 configuration
- âœ… Clerk authentication integration
- âœ… API client with all endpoints
- âœ… All pages implemented (Species, News, Protected Areas, Gallery, Users)
- âœ… Layout with responsive navigation
- âœ… Query client setup with TanStack Query
- âœ… Tailwind CSS v4 setup with Vite plugin
- âœ… shadcn/ui components integrated
- âœ… All management components migrated from web project
- âœ… TipTap rich text editor with all extensions
- âœ… Media picker modal
- âœ… Data tables with sorting and filtering
- âœ… Form components with validation
- âœ… JSZip for batch downloads

### Recent Updates:
- All imports now use `@wildtrip/shared` for types and constants
- `@wildtrip/shared` added as dependency in package.json
- Fixed compatibility with latest API response format
- Image display components properly handle CDN URLs

### Known Issues:
- Some endpoints in backend need to be exposed (locks, drafts)
- Form validation with React Hook Form + Zod pending (using HTML5 validation currently)

## Using Shared Package

```typescript
// Import types
import { RichContent, ContentBlock } from '@wildtrip/shared/types'

// Import constants
import { 
  CONSERVATION_STATUSES, 
  CHILE_REGIONS,
  MAIN_GROUPS,
  PROTECTED_AREA_TYPES
} from '@wildtrip/shared/constants'

// Import utilities
import { formatDate, slugify } from '@wildtrip/shared/utils'
```

## API Integration

The dashboard will communicate with the backend API:

```typescript
// Example API client setup
import { createAPIClient } from '@/lib/api/client'

const api = createAPIClient({
  baseURL: import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL,
  // Auth headers will be added by Clerk
})

// Usage in components
const { data: species } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ['species'],
  queryFn: () => api.species.findAll()
})
```

## Authentication Flow

1. User loads dashboard
2. Clerk checks authentication status
3. If not authenticated, redirect to web project's sign-in page
4. If authenticated, allow access and add auth headers to API requests

## Environment Variables

```env
# API Configuration
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Authentication
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...

# Public Web URL (for redirects)
VITE_WEB_URL=http://localhost:4321
```

## Development Guidelines

1. **Component Organization**:
   - Page components in `src/pages/`
   - Reusable components in `src/components/`
   - UI primitives in `src/components/ui/`

2. **State Management**:
   - Server state with TanStack Query
   - Local state with React hooks
   - Form state with React Hook Form

3. **Type Safety**:
   - Always use types from `@wildtrip/shared`
   - Define component props interfaces
   - Use Zod for runtime validation

4. **Code Style**:
   - Use `@/` imports for absolute paths
   - Functional components with hooks
   - Named exports for components

## Key Features to Implement

1. **Data Tables**: Sortable, filterable tables with pagination
2. **Forms**: Multi-step forms with validation
3. **Media Picker**: Modal for selecting images from gallery
4. **Rich Text Editor**: Tiptap with custom extensions
5. **Notifications**: Toast notifications for actions
6. **Loading States**: Skeletons and spinners
7. **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages

## Notes

- All management functionality has been successfully migrated from the web project âœ…
- The dashboard is a pure SPA with no SSR requirements âœ…
- Rich interactions with TipTap editor, media picker, and data tables âœ…
- Optimized for desktop usage with responsive design âœ…
- API client uses Vite proxy in development for CORS handling âœ…
- All components use TypeScript for type safety âœ…

## Important Implementation Details

1. **API Client**: Uses empty base URL in development to leverage Vite proxy
2. **Authentication**: Cookies are sent automatically with `withCredentials: true`
3. **Image Handling**: Uses Cloudflare R2 with image resizing via CDN
4. **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state, React hooks for local state
5. **Routing**: All routes are protected by authentication check

## Critical Image Display Rules

**IMPORTANT**: Images from the API come with full CDN URLs. In the dashboard:

1. **Display images directly** from the URLs provided by the API
2. **Do NOT construct URLs** - the backend provides complete URLs
3. **For thumbnails**, append Cloudflare Image Resizing parameters:
   ```typescript
   const thumbnailUrl = `${imageUrl}?width=200&height=200&fit=cover`
   ```

### Image Upload Flow
1. Upload images through `/api/gallery/upload`
2. Backend converts to WebP and stores in R2
3. Response includes full CDN URL
4. Use this URL directly in UI components

### Gallery Components
- `ImageGalleryManager`: Handles batch uploads and gallery management
- `MediaPickerModal`: Allows selecting images from existing gallery
- Both components handle full URLs from the API
